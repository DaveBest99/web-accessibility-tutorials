Web Accessibility and Standards Tutorials
===========================

Welcome to my web accessibility, web standards, and linked/structured data tutorials!

These are hands-on guides that add accessibility and linked data to web pages using the DOM's structure, presentation, and behavior layers, along with RDFa 1.1 lite, JSON-LD, and the schema.org and Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) ontologies/vocabularies. Where applicable, code examples are included for your use.
